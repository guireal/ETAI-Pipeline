# Baseline Predictive Pipeline -- ETAI
20260491 - GUILHERME REAL

LR - Train accuracy: 0.679
Test accuracy:  0.677
Gap (train - test): +0.001

DT - Train accuracy: 0.705
Test accuracy:  0.656
Gap (train - test): +0.050

Current best model: Logistic Regression is the best because it has zero overfitting (a train-test gap of +0.001 vs. +0.050) and a higher overall accuracy of 68%.


This is the **starting point** for your semester project: a small but *complete* predictive pipeline -- every piece a real project needs (entry point, config, data loading, preprocessing, model, evaluation), just kept as simple as possible for now.

The task: predict two-year recidivism using ProPublica's COMPAS
dataset -- the data behind a real 2016 investigation into a risk-
assessment algorithm actually used by US courts to help inform bail and sentencing decisions. See `data/README.md` for the full problem description and a complete data dictionary before you start.

It has some **deliberately weak spots**. Part of your work this
semester is finding them and making them better -- see the pipeline progress table below, which tracks what changes and why as the weeks
go on.

## Pipeline progress

This table is updated after each practical class, so you can always see what changed in the pipeline and why -- it's a running log, not a fixed syllabus.

| Week | Practical class focus | Added to the pipeline |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 | Introduction & baseline pipeline | Initial version: project structure, a single naive train/test split (no cross-validation), minimal preprocessing (drop rows with missing values, one-hot encode categoricals), logistic regression baseline, a first (deliberately simple) fairness check comparing our model's and COMPAS's own false-positive rate by race, train-vs-test accuracy reporting (to start spotting overfitting), and each run's full report saved automatically to `results/` |

## Environment setup

You only need to do this once per machine.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv                 # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate             # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```

### Windows -- PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv                  # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
venv\Scripts\activate                # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```
If PowerShell blocks the activation script, run this once first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### Windows -- cmd.exe
Same three steps as above, just with cmd's own activation command:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the environment is active you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt. To leave it later, run `deactivate` (same command on every OS).

### Every time after the first

Creating the environment and installing packages only needs to happen once, ever. Every other time you sit down to work -- a new terminal window, the next practical class, tomorrow -- you don't repeat any of the steps above. From the project's root folder, you just need to:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Windows**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

That's it -- activate, then run. If you don't see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt, the environment isn't active and `python main.py` may use the wrong Python (or fail to find a package) entirely.

## Running the pipeline

With the environment active (see above), from the project's root
folder, on any OS:
```bash
python main.py
```

This loads `config.yaml`, loads and preprocesses the data, trains the model, and prints:
- **train accuracy and test accuracy, side by side.** Comparing the two is how you catch overfitting: if the model looks much better on the data it was trained on than on data it's never seen, it has memorised rather than learned something that generalises. 
- a classification report on the test set
- a false-positive-rate-by-race comparison between our model and
  COMPAS's own score

All of this is also saved to a timestamped file in `results/` (e.g.`results/run_20260916_143012.txt`), so it doesn't just scroll past in your terminal -- open it later, or change something in `config.yaml` (like the model type) and compare the new file to the last one.
`results/` is created automatically the first time you run the
pipeline, and isn't tracked in git (see `.gitignore`) since it's
generated output, not source.

You're free to improve on this structure or restructure it entirely -- what matters is that your project stays runnable end-to-end with a single command, and that each piece (data, preprocessing, model, evaluation) stays easy to find and change independently.
